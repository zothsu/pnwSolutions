          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            Welcome to PNW Digital Solutions. These Terms & Conditions govern
            the web development and consulting services we provide to small
            businesses and artists. By engaging our services, you agree to be
            bound by these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            <strong>"Services"</strong> refers to our web development, WordPress
            maintenance, consultation, and related technology services.<br />
            <strong>"Client"</strong> refers to any individual or business entity
            that engages our services.<br />
            <strong>"Project"</strong> refers to any specific web development or
            consultation work agreed upon.<br />
            <strong>"Deliverables"</strong> refers to the completed work products
            we provide to you.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Service Agreement</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            All projects begin with a free 15-minute consultation to understand
            your needs. Detailed project scope, timeline, and pricing will be
            provided in a separate project agreement or statement of work. Quick
            updates are billed at $50/hour, and consultation services at
            $75/hour as outlined on our pricing page.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            For custom development projects, we typically require 50% payment
            upfront with the remainder due upon completion. Quick updates and
            consultation hours are billed upon completion. All invoices are due
            within 30 days of receipt. Late payments may incur a 1.5% monthly
            service charge.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            Clients are responsible for providing accurate content, images, and
            access credentials in a timely manner. You must maintain current
            backups of your website and provide necessary access to hosting
            accounts, domain registrars, and third-party services required for
            the project.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Intellectual Property & Ownership</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            Upon full payment, clients own all custom code and content we create
            specifically for their project. We retain the right to use open
            source technologies, frameworks, and general methodologies in future
            projects. Clients retain ownership of all content, images, and
            materials they provide.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Warranties & Support</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            We warrant that our work will function as specified for 30 days
            after project completion. This warranty covers defects in our
            workmanship but does not cover issues caused by third-party updates,
            hosting problems, or client modifications. Ongoing support is
            available at our standard hourly rates.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Website Hosting & Maintenance</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            We do not provide hosting services directly. Clients are responsible
            for their own hosting arrangements, though we can recommend suitable
            providers and assist with setup. Regular backups and security
            updates are the client's responsibility unless specifically
            contracted as part of our services.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            Our liability for any claims related to our services is limited to
            the amount paid for the specific project in question. We are not
            liable for indirect damages, lost profits, or business interruption.
            We recommend maintaining current backups and appropriate insurance
            for your business.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Project Cancellation</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            Either party may cancel a project with 48 hours written notice.
            Clients will be billed for all work completed up to the cancellation
            date. Upfront payments for incomplete projects will be refunded
            minus completed work and any expenses incurred on the client's
            behalf.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            Our projects often integrate with third-party services (hosting
            providers, email marketing platforms, payment processors, etc.). We
            are not responsible for the availability, functionality, or terms of
            service of these third-party providers. Clients are responsible for
            their own agreements with these services.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Confidentiality</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            We respect client confidentiality and will not share proprietary
            business information. We may showcase completed projects in our
            portfolio unless specifically requested not to do so. Client
            testimonials and reviews may be used in our marketing materials with
            permission.
          </p>

          <h2>13. Force Majeure</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            We are not liable for delays caused by circumstances beyond our
            reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters,
            internet outages, third-party service disruptions, or other
            unforeseen events.
          </p>

          <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
            the laws of the State of Washington, United States, without regard
            to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes will be resolved in
            the courts of Washington State.
          </p>

          <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p class="p-7">
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material
            changes will be posted on our website with at least 30 days notice.
            Continued engagement of our services after such modifications
            constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
          </p>
