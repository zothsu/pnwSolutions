                and artists. We specialize in WordPress customization, modern
                web development with React and Astro, and helping the little
                people build professional websites without enterprise price
                tags.

            <div class="faqcard">
              <h3>Who do you work with?</h3>
              <p>
                We specialize in helping small businesses, artists, and solo
                entrepreneurs who need professional websites but don't have
                enterprise budgets. This includes local restaurants, freelance
                consultants, photographers, musicians, Etsy shop owners, and
                service providers who want to compete online.

                We focus exclusively on bringing enterprise-grade open source
                technologies to small businesses at affordable rates. We charge
                $50/hour for quick updates, provide honest pricing upfront, and
                use proven technologies instead of experimental solutions. You
                work directly with us, not junior developers or outsourced
                teams.

            <div class="faqcard">
              <h3>What services do you offer?</h3>
              <p>
                We offer three main services: Quick Updates ($50/hour) for small
                changes to existing WordPress or Squarespace sites, Custom
                Development (custom quotes) for new websites and complex
                projects, and Consultation ($75/hour) for strategic guidance on
                technology choices and digital planning. Visit our
                <a href="/pricing">pricing page </a> for detailed information.

            </div>

            <div class="faqcard">
              <h3>How much does a new website cost?</h3>
              <p>
                Custom development pricing varies based on your specific needs,
                complexity, and timeline. Simple business websites typically
                start around $1,000-5,000, while more complex e-commerce or
                custom applications can range higher. We provide detailed quotes
                after understanding your requirements during our free 15-minute
                consultation.

            <div class="faqcard">
              <h3>Do you offer payment plans?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, we understand that small businesses need flexible payment
                options. For larger projects, we typically structure payments as
                50% upfront and 50% upon completion. For very large projects, we
                can discuss milestone-based payment plans to spread costs over
                time.

            <div class="faqcard">
              <h3>Do you offer ongoing maintenance?</h3>
              <p>
                Absolutely! Many clients use our $50/hour Quick Updates service
                for ongoing maintenance, content updates, and small
                improvements. We don't lock you into monthly contracts - you
                only pay for the time you actually use.

              <h3>How do we get started?</h3>
              <p>
                Every project starts with a free 15-minute consultation where we
                listen to your needs and explain how we can help - no sales
                pitch, just honest advice. If it's a good fit, we'll provide a
                clear quote and timeline. For quick updates, we can often start
                work the same day.

            <div class="faqcard">

              <p>
                Quick updates are usually completed within 1-3 business days.
                Simple business websites typically take 2-4 weeks, while more
                complex projects with e-commerce or custom functionality can
                take 6-12 weeks. We'll give you a realistic timeline during the

              <h3>What do I need to provide?</h3>
              <p>
                To get started, we just need access to your current website (if
                you have one), a clear idea of what you want to achieve, and any
                specific content or branding guidelines. Don't worry if you're
                not sure - we can help clarify your needs during the
                consultation.

            <div class="faqcard">
              <h3>Will my website be mobile-friendly?</h3>

                Absolutely! All websites we develop are fully responsive and
                mobile-friendly, ensuring they look great and function well on
                all devices. We test on multiple screen sizes and can provide
                specific mobile design samples upon request.

              <h3>What platforms do you use for web development?</h3>
              <p>
                We primarily use WordPress for content-driven websites and
                e-commerce, React for interactive web applications, and Astro
                for ultra-fast static sites. We can also work with existing
                Squarespace or Wix sites for updates and improvements. We choose

                We can help you set up hosting and register domains, but we
                don't provide hosting services directly. This keeps your costs
                low and gives you flexibility to choose the hosting provider
                that best fits your needs and budget. We'll recommend reliable,

            <div class="faqcard">
              <h3>What about website security and backups?</h3>

                All websites we build follow security best practices, including
                SSL certificates, secure hosting configurations, and regular
                updates. We'll show you how to maintain backups or can set up
                automated backup systems. For WordPress sites, we recommend
                specific security plugins and practices.

                If there's an issue with our work within 30 days of project
                completion, we'll fix it at no charge. For issues that arise
                later due to plugin updates, hosting problems, or other factors,
                we can help troubleshoot and resolve them through our Quick
                Updates service.

                Can you help me understand website analytics and performance?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Absolutely! We can set up Google Analytics, explain what the
                data means for your business, and help you track the metrics
                that matter most to your goals. We also offer consultation
                sessions focused on improving website performance and search
                engine optimization.
